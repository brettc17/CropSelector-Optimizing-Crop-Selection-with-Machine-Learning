However, traditional methods of measuring soil metrics like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value are expensive and time-consuming. As a result, farmers often face budget constraints and must prioritize which metrics to measure.\n\nIn this project, the objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to assist farmers in selecting the best crop for their fields based on soil condition. By analyzing a dataset containing soil metrics and corresponding crop types, we aim to build multi-class classification models to predict the type of crop that would thrive in a given soil environment. Additionally, we will identify the single most important feature for predictive performance, aiding farmers in making informed decisions to maximize crop yield.\n\n**Dataset Description:**\n\nThe dataset, named \"soil_measures.csv,\" includes the following features:\n\n- \"N\": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil\n- \"P\": Phosphorous content ratio in the soil\n- \"K\": Potassium content ratio in the soil\n- \"pH\": pH value of the soil\n- \"crop\": Categorical values representing various crop types (target variable)\n\nEach row in the dataset represents measurements of soil metrics in a particular field, along with the corresponding optimal crop specified in the \"crop\" column.\n\n**Project Goals:**\n\n1. Build multi-class classification models to predict the type of crop based on soil metrics.\n2. Identify the single most important feature for predictive performance.\n3. Assist farmers in selecting the best crop for their fields by providing actionable insights derived from machine learning analysis.\n\nThrough this project, we aim to demonstrate how machine learning can be utilized to optimize crop selection and contribute to the success of agricultural practices, ultimately benefiting farmers and enhancing agricultural productivity.","metadata":{},"id":"d3d001b0-2e2f-4b58-8442-99520bad831f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)\nX = crops.drop(columns=['crop'])\ny = crops['crop']\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a logistic regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n\n# Get feature importance\nfeature_importance = model.coef_[0]\nbest_feature_index = feature_importance.argmax()\nbest_feature_name = X.columns[best_feature_index]\n\n# Create a dictionary containing the best predictive feature name and its evaluation score\nbest_predictive_feature = {best_feature_name: accuracy}\nprint(\"Best predictive feature:\", best_predictive_feature)\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":606,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)\nX = crops.drop(columns=['crop'])\ny = crops['crop']\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a logistic regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n\n# Get feature importance\nfeature_importance = model.coef_[0]\nbest_feature_index = feature_importance.argmax()\nbest_feature_name = X.columns[best_feature_index]\n\n# Create a dictionary containing the best predictive feature name and its evaluation score\nbest_predictive_feature = {best_feature_name: accuracy}\nprint(\"Best predictive feature:\", best_predictive_feature)\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1715628353926,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":"22940898-cf38-4171-8bce-ee68a9abb7d1","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":59,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Accuracy: 0.6113636363636363\nBest predictive feature: {'K': 0.6113636363636363}\n"}]},{"source":"# Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the soil metrics dataset and applying machine learning techniques, we have achieved an accuracy of 61.14% in predicting the type of crop based on soil condition.
